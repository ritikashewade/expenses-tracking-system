# expenses-tracking-system
An Expense Tracking System built using Spring Boot and Thymeleaf helps users manage their personal or business expenses efficiently. It allows users to add, view, and categorize expenses, and provides a simple interface for tracking spending over time.

The backend, developed with Spring Boot, handles the business logic and database interactions, while Thymeleaf is used to create dynamic, user-friendly HTML pages for displaying data. This system supports CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for expense entries and offers features like filtering expenses by category or date.

It's an effective tool for monitoring financial habits in a clean, easy-to-use interface.
